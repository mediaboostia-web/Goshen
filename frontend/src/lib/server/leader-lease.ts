/**
 * Redis-backed leader-election for cron ticks.
 *
 * Multiple replicas run the same setInterval loops. Without coordination
 * they each execute the same cron tick — wasted DB writes, double emails,
 * contention. This helper makes only one instance per `name` run a tick:
 *
 *   await withLease(redis, 'verification-cleanup', 60_000, async () => {
 *     await prisma.verificationCode.deleteMany(...);
 *   });
 *
 * Mechanism:
 *   SET cron:lease:<name> <holderId> NX EX <ttlSeconds>
 *
 *   - NX = only set if not exists (atomic via Upstash).
 *   - EX = auto-expires so a crashed leader's lock is released.
 *
 * If we got the lease, run fn(). On exit (success OR failure) we release
 * iff we still hold it (the holderId guard prevents releasing someone
 * else's lease in case ours had expired mid-fn).
 *
 * Pick `ttlMs` to comfortably exceed the expected fn() runtime. Too low =
 * two instances run in parallel; too high = if the leader crashes its
 * peers wait until expiry. Cron-tick scale: 30s for fast ticks, several
 * minutes for slow ones.
 *
 * No-Redis fallback: when `redis` is undefined (dev / no Upstash configured),
 * `withLease` just runs fn() unconditionally. That's correct for the
 * single-instance dev case the rest of the boilerplate already assumes.
